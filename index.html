            About me: I am a student of Occidental College (class of '23) from Danville, California.<br>
            However, I was born in Denver, Colorado but grew up in the Bay Area. I went to high school at San Francisco University HS.<br>
            Planning to major in Economics and minor in Computer Science. I enjoy both subjects very much. <br>
            Played tennis from when I was four years old until now. I was on the varsity team for my high school and co-captain for my senior year.<br>
            My team won back to back section championships.
