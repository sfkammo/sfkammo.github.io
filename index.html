            About me: I am a student of Occidental College (class of '23) from Danville, California.<br>
            However, I was born in Denver, Colorado but grew up in the Bay Area. I went to high school at San Francisco University HS.<br>
            Planning to major in Economics and minor in Computer Science. I enjoy both subjects very much. <br>
            Played tennis from when I was four years old until now. I was on the varsity team for my high school and co-captain for my senior year.<br>
            My team won back to back section championships. You can find our results here on <span title="MaxPreps"><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/local/team/schedule.aspx?schoolid=7ad2b4f5-955e-4a92-ac1f-a1acced4df4b&ssid=81e91563-0149-4ef0-b8ec-90b68310265f">MaxPreps</a></span>.<br>
